Yes, use Replit Auth.

Proceed with an implementation plan AND code changes (no further questions), with these requirements:

NON-NEGOTIABLE SECURITY
- Dashboard must be protected server-side (not just hidden in the React UI).
- All dashboard-related API endpoints must require auth and return 401/403 if not logged in.
- Use Replit Auth’s httpOnly cookie session. Do NOT store tokens in localStorage.
- Prevent open redirects: only allow redirects to same-origin relative paths.
- Add basic rate limiting on auth-adjacent endpoints if any exist on our side.

STACK ASSUMPTIONS
- Frontend: React + Tailwind UI
- Backend: whichever Node server this Replit template uses (Express/Fastify/etc.) — detect and use what’s already present.
- If a DB is required for Replit Auth persistence, use Replit’s recommended DB setup.
  - Only use PostgreSQL if the official Replit Auth integration requires it; otherwise use the simplest supported option.
  - Provide setup steps for Replit DB and required env vars.

DELIVERABLES
1) Show the current detected project structure and identify where the server lives.
2) Implement login flow using Replit Auth and add a /login page with:
   - “Continue with Google”
   - “Continue with GitHub”
   - email login option supported by Replit Auth
3) Protected dashboard route:
   - /dashboard should redirect to /login if unauthenticated (server-enforced).
   - Client-side guard is optional but helpful for UX.
4) Protected APIs:
   - /api/me (returns user info when logged in)
   - /api/pins (example protected resource)
   - All /api/* should require auth by middleware (or at least all dashboard APIs).
5) Tier system for future paid features:
   - Create user_tiers table (or equivalent): user_id, tier (free|premium), status, current_period_end
   - Add `requireTier("premium")` helper and show one example endpoint guarded by it.
   - Add free-limit example: free users max 3 pins.
6) Provide exact files/patches + run instructions.
7) Provide a short test plan:
   - logged out: cannot load /dashboard, cannot call /api/*
   - logged in: can access
   - cookie flags correct in production mode

OUTPUT FORMAT
- Give me a step-by-step implementation plan first.
- Then provide file-by-file changes with full code blocks.
- Then list env vars and Replit setup steps.

Do not ask “does this sound good” — implement it.
