You are improving the backend logic of the GetStack web technology analyzer.

Goal:
Upgrade plugin detection for WordPress sites, WITHOUT changing the UI or output structure.

Context:
GetStack already detects some plugins by scanning a website’s HTML and asset URLs, but we want more reliable and extensive results.

---

TASK DETAILS:

1. Keep the UI and data schema exactly as they are.  
   You may modify or extend internal detection functions, but must preserve the JSON output shape currently used by the app.

2. Expand plugin detection by adding additional **methods** — not just more plugin names.

### DETECTION METHODS TO IMPLEMENT

#### (A) Path detection
- Continue scanning for `/wp-content/plugins/<plugin-slug>/` in:
  - `<link>` tags
  - `<script>` tags
  - Inline JS or HTML attributes
- Capture version numbers from query strings (e.g. `?ver=1.2.3`).

#### (B) Classname / ID detection
- Check `<body>`, `<div>`, and `<section>` elements for known CSS classnames or IDs used by popular plugins.
  Examples:
  - `elementor-page`, `elementor-section`, `et_pb_`, `vc_row`, `woocommerce`, `wpcf7`, `rank-math-schema`
- Maintain a dictionary mapping of class patterns → plugin names.

#### (C) Script and style handles
- Inspect filenames and inline script identifiers:
  - e.g., `elementor-frontend.min.js`, `woocommerce.min.js`, `yoast-schema-graph`
- Use substring or regex matching for known patterns.

#### (D) Meta / JSON-LD injection
- Parse `<meta>` and `<script type="application/ld+json">` tags for structured data that references plugin origins.
  - e.g., `"@id":"rank-math-schema"`, `"yoast-schema-graph"`.

#### (E) REST endpoints
- Fetch `/wp-json/` and check for known plugin REST namespaces:
  - WooCommerce → `wc/`
  - Yoast → `yoast/`
  - Contact Form 7 → `contact-form-7/`
  - Jetpack → `jetpack/`
- Append any confirmed matches to the detected plugin list with `confidence: 1.0`.

#### (F) Signature database
- Create or extend a `signatures.json` file with known fingerprints:
